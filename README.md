# L&T EduTech Hackathon
#### Problem Domain: AI Solutions for Industrial and Societal Problems
**PS1 -**

**Description -** Concrete cracking is a major issue in Bridge Engineering. Detection of cracks facilitates the design, construction and maintenance of bridges effectively.
**Requirement Specification:**

-   Use open source dataset (From the link:  [https://cutt.ly/PS_1_dataset](https://cutt.ly/PS_1_dataset))
-   Develop a suitable Deep Learning framework which can detect the crack in the image from the dataset
-   Transfer Learning based DL framework would be appreciated

**Judging Metrics:** Provide  Precision, Recall and F1 score as Judging metrics
